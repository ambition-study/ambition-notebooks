# ambition-notebooks

Various Jupyter notebooks

We use `--notebook` in `django-extensions` `shell_plus` to start up the jupyter notebook server.

To use the notebook you need a functional `ambition` setup that points to the LIVE database.

Then run any of the notebooks in this repo run `jupyter` notebook from the console:

    (~/source/ambition)$ python manage.py shell_plus --notebook
